# What is SMS Gateway?

**SMS Gateway** is [TAS Technologies Group's](https://tastechgroup.com) programmable SMS messaging platform for critical business communications.

## Feature Highlights

- **Dual Redundant Aggregators**

  SMS Gateway utilizes dual redundant aggregators with automatic failover to provide the highest level of redundancy in the industry. Utilizing two of the largest aggregators in the world, you can rest assured your messages will be delivered.

- **Automatic Failover**

  Automatic failover ensures that if one provider goes down, our system will automatically route the message through the second provider. You don't need to take any action, and you won't even notice. Your messages will go out smoothly without any interruption.

- **One-Click Confirmation**

  Built to work with Amtelco, Telescan, and other software platforms through WCTP or API integration. One-Click Confirmation removes the need for your customers to reply to the text message for confirmation. We remove this information and replace it with a simple link. When the customer clicks the link, we send you the confirmation code. It's that simple. There is no cost for the inbound confirmation message.

- **WCTP & REST API Integration**

  SMS Gateway has two integrations: The industry-standardized [Wireless Communications Transfer Protocol (WCTP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_Communications_Transfer_Protocol) allows easy integration into compatible platforms, such as Amtelco's Intelligent Series. Additionally, a simple REST API is available for integration into any platform capable of calling with the web service.
